    <h1>About Me: </h1>


    <h2>Hobbies & Interests:</h2>

    <p>Outside of the classroom, I have many different hobbies and interests. Some of my favorite things to do include
        traveling, film photography, and snowboarding.</p>

    <h3> Travel:</h3>

    <p>One of my biggest passions is traveling and learning more about the world I live in. My most recent trip was last
        year when I spent a week in Greece with my brother.</p>

    <h3>Film Photography:</h3>

    <p>Another one of my passions is film photography. The two cameras that I have are an Olympus OM10 and a Cannon Sure
        Shot 85 zoom. I usually bring one of my cameras everywhere I go and enjoy the creative process of capturing an
        image. The image below is one of my favorites that I've taken.</p>
