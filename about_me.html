            <h2>Hobbies & Interests:</h2>


            <p>Outside of the classroom, I have many different hobbies <br> and interests. Some of my favorite things to
                do
                include traveling, <br>film photography, and snowboarding.</p>

            <br> <br>
            <h2> Travel:</h2>

            <p>One of my biggest passions is traveling and <br>learning more about the world I live in. <br> My most
                recent
                trip was
                last
                year when I spent a week in Greece with my brother.</p>

            <h2>Film Photography:</h2>

            <p>Another one of my passions is film photography. <br>The two cameras that I have are an Olympus OM10 and a
                Cannon
                Sure Shot 85 zoom. I usually bring one of my <br> cameras everywhere I go and enjoy the creative
                process
                of capturing
                an
                image. <br> The image below is one of my favorites that I've taken.</p>

            <h2> Snowboarding:</h2>

            <p>During the winter, my favorite thing to do is go snowboarding. <br> I usally go almost every other week.
